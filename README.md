# Initial Virtual Studio code set-up
In the first **handtracking** code compilation set on VScode(install Python package first), it might be asked to adjust your libraries for a **ModuleNotFoundError**, it fails because some libraries (extra tools or packages your code needs) are missing.

Installing **Anaconda** (https://anaconda.org/) helps because:
it comes with commonly used libraries already built-in and in that way, VS Code can find those libraries and run your code without errors.
It creates a safe environment for possible compiling errors done in VScode.
